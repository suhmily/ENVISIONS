        "content": "There are five types of items in the SVG of the HTML. The 'fill' attribute determines the color of each item.\n1. Digit (text, 0-9). If font-size==10px, it is small. If font-size==20px, it is large. You can use `isdigit()` to find digits because digits and letters are both `text`. You can use item.text == '<some_digit>' to find a specific digit.\n2. Letter (text, A-Z & a-z). If font-size==10px, it is small. If font-size==20px, it is large. You can use `isalpha()` to find letters because digits and letters are both `text`. You can use item.text == '<some_letter>' to find a specific letter.\n3. Triangle (shape, polygon). If the distance between the x coordinates of two points is 5, it is small. If 10, it is large. The points are split by space and the coordinates of each point are split by comma. You can use `int(shape['points'].split()[1].split(',')[0]) - int(shape['points'].split()[0].split(',')[0])` to calculate whether it is large or small.\n4. Circle (shape, circle). If r==5, it is small. If r==10, it is large.\n5. Rectangle (shape, rect). If the width and height are both 10, it is small. If one of them is 20, it is large.\n\nFilter the following raw HTML state into a clean observation via code based on the task.\nState:\n<div id=\"wrap\" data-wob_ref=\"2\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">\n  <div id=\"query\"><div>How many small blue shapes are there?</div><div></div></div>\n  <div id=\"area\" data-wob_ref=\"3\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">\n    <svg id=\"area_svg\" data-wob_ref=\"4\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\"><rect x=\"25\" y=\"65\" width=\"10\" height=\"10\" fill=\"green\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" data-wob_ref=\"5\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\"></rect><text x=\"70\" y=\"10\" fill=\"black\" text-anchor=\"middle\" alignment-baseline=\"central\" font-size=\"10px\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" data-wob_ref=\"6\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">h</text><text x=\"90\" y=\"90\" fill=\"green\" text-anchor=\"middle\" alignment-baseline=\"central\" font-size=\"10px\" style=\"cursor:pointer;\" data-wob_ref=\"7\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">X</text></svg>\n    <div id=\"count-buttons\" data-wob_ref=\"8\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\"><button data-wob_ref=\"9\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">2</button><button data-wob_ref=\"10\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">9</button><button data-wob_ref=\"11\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">1</button><button data-wob_ref=\"12\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">6</button><button data-wob_ref=\"13\" data-wob_eps=\"e0\">0</button></div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n\nTo achieve this, use Python with the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML and extract the relevant information. Then, compare the characteristics of each item in the SVG to determine how many satisfying items are present. For example, if the question is to count shapes, then we do not care about digits and letters. If the question is to count a certain letter or digit such as 'X' or '5', then we do not care about shapes. If there are multiple conditions such as 'black Xs' or 'large red shapes', then you need to be careful to filter each type of element respectively. Keep the format of the observation in a string `obs` the same as 'How many xxx items are there? The answer is xx'. The string of the raw state is already in the variable `state` so do not repeat the state in the code.\n\nHere are some examples:\nWrite code within three backticks '```' to answer How many yellow items are there?\nCode:\n```python\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n# parse the HTML state\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(state, 'html.parser')\nsvg = soup.find('svg')\nitems = svg.find_all()\n# count the number of yellow items\ncount = 0\nfor item in items:\n    # iterate through all items in the SVG, checking which one is yellow\n    if item['fill'] == 'yellow':\n        count += 1\n# format the observation string\nobs = f\"How many yellow items are there?
